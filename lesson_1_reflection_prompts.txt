How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped a lot since it was pretty easy to spot the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It could help a lot when working in big projects by keeping track of what I have been working on

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have the control to modify the versions that you are working with at the time that you think is right

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git allows this because it is code oriented, this helps in making a change that will affect all the project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log helps me find the new changes made into the code/project; git diff aids me in finding the new changes made in the project between commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It can help a lot because you can check the previous versions of your project before a bug happened

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Team projects
