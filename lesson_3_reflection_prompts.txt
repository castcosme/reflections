When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Whenever you are working on a team project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To prevent merge conflicts

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: A clone made in the GitHub servers that refers to the original repository
    Clone: A clone that can be remote or local of a repository
    Branch: A branch of a repository in which new features are worked on

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Have a workaround whenever there's a bug or a conflict

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Working along people physically so that everyone knows what's going on, it would be easier
 to discuss changes but it would be extremely hard to work and make progress

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Whenever you need to work on a bug in a feature created in that branch.
